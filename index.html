        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to "Earthquakes and Trends," where we embark on a journey
          through seismic history and modern data analysis. Earthquakes have
          long fascinated and terrified humanity, and we're here to unravel
          their mysteries using a wealth of information, including data from the
          USGS and other reliable sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          From ancient myths to modern science, earthquakes have captivated our
          imagination. Early humans pondered their origins, while scientific
          pioneers like John Michell and Robert Mallet paved the way for
          understanding seismic waves. The birth of seismology and the
          establishment of the USGS marked turning points, leading to today's
          advanced technologies that enable us to monitor, measure, and even
          predict these seismic events.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to long-term records (since about 1900), the USGS (United
          States Geological Survey) concludes we expect about 16 major
          earthquakes in any given year. That includes 15 earthquakes in the
          magnitude 7 range and one earthquake magnitude 8.0 or greater. In the
          past 40-50 years, our records show that we have exceeded the long-term
          average number of major earthquakes about a dozen times. The year with
          the largest total was 2010, with 23 major earthquakes (greater than or
          equal to magnitude 7.0). In other years the total was well below the
          annual long-term average of 16 major earthquakes. 1989 only had 6
          major earthquakes and 1988 only had 7.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project, we delve into data to answer a vital question: Are
          earthquakes on the rise? Through captivating visualizations and data
          analysis, we'll uncover patterns and shifts in tectonic behavior. By
          navigating this interactive dashboard, you'll join us in the quest to
          understand our dynamic planet and ensure a safer future.
